## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict house prices using various features of the houses provided in the dataset. The dataset is part of a Kaggle competition and includes information such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and other characteristics of the houses.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of:
- Training data: Used to train the machine learning model.
- Test data: Used to evaluate the model's performance.

Key features in the dataset include:
- **LotArea**: Lot size in square feet.
- **YearBuilt**: Original construction date.
- **SalePrice**: Target variable (price of the house).

## Workflow

The workflow in the notebook includes:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies in the data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. **Model Training**: Using machine learning algorithms to train the predictive model.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Al-Muhannad/house-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook houses_kaggle_competition.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to reproduce the results.

## Results

The final model achieves a **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** of approximately `0.17920` on the test set (to be updated with specific results).
